/*
Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

        EncodeandDecodeTinyURL solution = new EncodeandDecodeTinyURL();
       // System.out.println(solution.removeDuplicates("abbaca"));
    }

// below is the tiny url solution in java, also this is the similar method in industry.
// In industry, most of shorten url service is by database, one auto increasing long number as primary key.
// whenever a long url need to be shorten, append to the database, and return the primary key number.
// (the database is very easy to distribute to multiple machine like HBase, or even you can use the raw file system to store data and improve performance by shard and replica).
// Note, it's meaningless to promise the same long url to be shorten as the same short url. if you do the promise and use something like hash to check existing, the benefit is must less than the cost.
// Note: if you want the shorted url contains '0-9a-zA-Z' instead of '0-9', then you need to use 62 number system, not 10 number system(decimal) to convert the primary key number. like 123->'123' in decimal, 123->'1Z' in 62 number system (or '0001Z' for align).
