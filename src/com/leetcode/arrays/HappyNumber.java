202. 0Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return True if n is a happy number, and False if not.

Example:

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1(2) + 9(2) = 82
8(2) + 2(2) = 68
6(2) + 8(2) = 100
1(2) + 0(2) + 0(2) = 1
